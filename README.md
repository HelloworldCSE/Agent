üß™ Summary of AutoGen AI Agent Integration & Debugging
‚úÖ Goal:
To implement a multi-agent AI pipeline using Mistral with AutoGen-like logic, where agents (Scanner, Fixer, Tester, Validator) collaboratively scan and secure Python code.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced & Fixes
1. Incorrect Agent Configuration with AutoGen
Issue: You used the AssistantAgent with an incorrect config argument, which caused runtime errors.

Reason: AutoGen expects llm_config instead of config; Mistral wasn‚Äôt directly supported without adapter setup.

Fix: You shifted from autogen package to directly calling Mistral API using requests for clarity and control.

2. Prompt Issues with Agents Giving Too Much Output
Issue: Agents like Fixer and Tester returned verbose explanations and docstrings.

Reason: The prompts lacked strict output boundaries.

Fix: Refined prompts to:

Only use in-line agent comments

Suppress external explanations

Add explicit examples and negative instructions (e.g., "Do not include docstrings")

3. Agent Loop Re-flagging Clean Code
Issue: Re-inputting already fixed code still triggered Fixer or Tester suggestions.

Reason: LLMs are probabilistic and may try to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù even when no issue exists.

Fix:

Updated ScannerAgent prompt to objectively return "No vulnerabilities found" when appropriate.

Added hash comparison logic to stop loops when code output doesn‚Äôt change.

4. HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests
Issue: Mistral API returned rate-limit errors.

Reason: Multiple rapid API calls during agent loops triggered throttling.

Fix: Added:

Sleep delays

Exponential retry logic

Tip to monitor API usage via the Mistral console

5. Final Enhancement
Integrated all logic into one script:

Multi-agent feedback loop

Hash checks

Final output with only secure, annotated code

‚úÖ Outcome:
You now have a reliable, clean, and modular Mistral-powered AI agent flow that scans code for security, fixes it, suggests test cases, and validates the result ‚Äî all while avoiding over-response and rate limits.
